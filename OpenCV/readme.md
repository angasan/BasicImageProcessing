# OpenCV - Finding faces in a news paper

With this project I designed code that lets you find all the faces in a newspaper page that contains a keyword. The model used belongs to the pre-trained models offered by the OpenCV package.

The two cases tested are with keywords: 'Christopher' and 'Mark'. In the first test, I used a smaller file (since I wanted to do quicker tests) while on the second I used all the images available.
